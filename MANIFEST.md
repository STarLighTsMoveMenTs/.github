# StatesFlowWishes – Manifest

**Der Fluss der Wünsche, der in Taten mündet.**  
*The flow of wishes that leads to actions.*

---

## Vision

StatesFlowWishes represents our commitment to transforming aspirations into tangible actions. We believe in the power of collective intent, guided by principles of consent, safety, and community.

## Core Principles

### 💫 Leitstern | Guiding Star

**Niemand bleibt allein.**  
*Nobody stays alone.*

In our community, isolation has no place. We stand together, support each other, and ensure that every voice is heard and valued. Whether you're a contributor, user, or visitor, you are part of our constellation.

### 📜 Grundsatz | Principle

**Kein Consent → kein Content.**  
*No Consent → no Content.*

Consent is not optional—it is foundational. Every action, contribution, and interaction must be built on explicit, informed, and freely given consent. Without consent, there is no content, no collaboration, no community.

**This means:**
- Clear communication before any action
- Respect for boundaries and preferences
- The right to withdraw consent at any time
- Transparent processes and decision-making

### 🛡️ Haltung | Attitude

**Sicherheit vor Geschwindigkeit · Herkunft & Hash.**  
*Safety before Speed · Origin & Hash.*

We prioritize:
1. **Safety over Speed**: Rushing leads to harm. We move deliberately, ensuring security, accessibility, and care in everything we build.
2. **Origin & Hash**: Transparency and traceability matter. We honor the source of contributions, maintain clear provenance, and use cryptographic verification where it matters.

**Practical applications:**
- Security reviews before deployment
- Accessibility testing for all features
- Proper attribution and licensing
- Verifiable builds and reproducible processes

### 🎵 Refrain

**Wir geben, wir verbinden, wir heilen.**  
*We give, we connect, we heal.*

Our actions are guided by:
- **Geben (Give)**: We contribute freely, share knowledge, and support growth
- **Verbinden (Connect)**: We build bridges, foster collaboration, and create networks of care
- **Heilen (Heal)**: We repair what is broken, address harm, and work toward restoration
