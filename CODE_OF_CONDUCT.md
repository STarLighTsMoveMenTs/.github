# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

Guided by our **StatesFlowWishes** manifest, we pledge to make participation in our community a safe, respectful, and empowering experience for everyone.

**Niemand bleibt allein.** *Nobody stays alone.*

## Our Standards

### Consent-First Approach

**Kein Consent → kein Content.**

- Always ask before including someone's work, ideas, or personal information
- Respect "no" without pressure or retaliation
- Provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms
- Honor withdrawal of consent at any time

### Safety Before Speed

**Sicherheit vor Geschwindigkeit · Herkunft & Hash.**

- Security and accessibility come before feature velocity
- Properly attribute all contributions
- Maintain transparency in processes and decisions
- Verify and validate before deploying

### Community Spirit

**Wir geben, wir verbinden, wir heilen.**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward other community members
- Sharing knowledge and supporting growth
- Building bridges across different perspectives
- Addressing harm with care and accountability

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Violating consent in any form
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement

### Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting the project team. All reports will be handled with discretion and confidentiality.

### Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report promptly
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate thoroughly and fairly
3. **Action**: We will take appropriate action based on our findings
4. **Follow-up**: We will follow up with both parties as appropriate

### Consequences

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

Depending on the severity, consequences may include:
- A private, written warning
- A public warning
- Temporary ban from the community
- Permanent ban from the community

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including:
- GitHub repositories and discussions
- Issue trackers and pull requests
- Community chat channels
- Social media and public forums
- Events and meetups (virtual or physical)

It also applies when an individual is representing the project or community in public spaces.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1, and enhanced with our StatesFlowWishes principles.
